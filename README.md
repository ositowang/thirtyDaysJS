# 30 Days Javascript Challenge

JavaScript 30 Day Challenge with Web Bos.  
I am a web developer with some experience. When I first found this chanllenge sets, I am not very motivated to jump in.\
However, if it is a long time without original javascript, you will become a framework developer. So I choose to take part\
in this challenge and it really gives me some refreshment & a lot of funÔºÅ\
Highly recommended for starters!\
